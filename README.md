Street Potters <br>
 <br>
Overview <br> 
Street Potters is a digital platform aimed at empowering street vendors by providing them a 
space to connect with potential customers. Street vendors often struggle with gaining visibility, 
managing customer interactions, and increasing sales due to the lack of digital tools tailored to 
their needs. Street Potters bridges this gap by allowing vendors to create profiles, list products, 
and enable customers to search for nearby vendors, browse products, and place orders online.<br> 
<br>

availability, and images. <br>

the product they are looking for. <br> 
● Customer Reviews and Ratings: Build trust by allowing customers to review and rate 
vendors. <br> 
● Order Management: Customers can place orders, and vendors can update product 
availability and manage orders in real time.<br>  
● Payment Integration: Future plans to integrate secure payment methods. <br>
